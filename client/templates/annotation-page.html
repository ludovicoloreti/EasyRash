        <p>The great amount of data available on citations and, in particular, the possibility
  				of navigating papers through citations are powerful tools in the hand of the
  				researchers. Researcher performs different tasks on citations according to the role
  				they play. The researcher is first of all a <em>reader</em>, who reads articles and
  				navigate them through citations. The process of finding relevant works is very
  				common when writing new papers and project proposals: indeed, a researcher is also
  				an <em>author</em>. The research community also relies on peer-review processes, which
  				require researchers to also act as <em>reviewers</em> or <em>editors</em>. When
  				reviewing papers, a researcher uses citations and checks, for instance, the number
  				of self-citations or the publication year of the cited papers. Citations are also
  				increasingly used for evaluation purposes. Researchers are then asked to be part of
  				academic boards in charge of evaluating research products. Our analysis covers such
  				a scenario with a specific role: <em>evaluator</em>. Researchers are involved in
  				organizing scientific events, thus we added the role of <em>event organizer.</em></p>
  			<p>In this section we describe some of the most common tasks that researchers perform on
  				bibliographies when playing all these roles. There are many other tasks
  				characterizing each of these roles but they are left out of discussion, since they
  				are not specific on bibliographies. </p>
